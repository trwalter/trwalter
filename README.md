My main interest is related to the observation and modelling of volcano and earthquake deformation processes and source characterization. I am combining remote sensing techniques with geophysical and geodetic field observations. Synthetic apertur radar (SAR and InSAR) and high resolution photogrammetry and UAV techniques (pixel tracking, structure from motion) are of great value for studying volcanic processes, such as lava dome growth and eruption initiation, or structural and gravitational instability.
